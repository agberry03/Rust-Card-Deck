# Overview

I wrote a program that runs a game of Black Jack between two players.
The players start with 2 cards, and can hit for more until they pass, get Black Jack,
or go above Black Jack. Once both players pass, their final scores are compared and a
winner is declared.

I wrote this software as an introduction to how the Rust programming language works
and to become more comfortable with using the Rust language.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor, with Rust extensions installed.

I used the Rust language and the deckofcards Rust Crate.

# Future Work

- Make a method for the repetitive code in the main method.
- Add other simple card games to the program.
- Make the program more structured by separating function into their own files and classes.
